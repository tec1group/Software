; JMON - JIM'S MONITOR
; BY JIM ROBERTSON
;
; PORTED TO THE SOUTHERN CROSS COMPUTER BY CRAIG RS JONES   MAY 2021
;
;
; FILENAME : JMON_SCV01.ASM
; VERSION : 1
;
; A PORT OF JMON TO THE SOUTHERN CROSS COMPUTER (SC)
; THE MEMORY MAP OF THE SC IS DECODED INTO 8 X 8K BLOCKS. 
; THE ROM RESIDES AT 0000H TO 1FFFH (8K)
; THE RAM RESIDES AT 2000H T0 3FFFH (8K)
;
; CHANGES;
; * IO PORT NUMBERS HAVE CHANGED
;
; * RAM VARIABLES HAVE MOVED FROM 0800H TO THE START OF SC RAM 2000H 
;
; * 7 SEGMENT DISPLAY CODES HAVE CHANGED 
;
; * A NEW LCD INITIALISATION ROUTINE TESTS THE BUSY FLAG AND CG RAM ADDRESS FOR LCD DETECTION INSTEAD
;   OF LOOKING FOR THE SPACE (0X20) CHARACTER IN THE CGRAM
;
; * THE KEYBOARD ENTRY ROUTINE USES THE DA FROM THE KEYBOARD IO PORT INSTEAD OF THE FROM THE DATA LATCH OF THE (NON-EXISTANT) DAT BOARD  
;
; * THE KEY CODES HAVE REMAINED THE SAME FOR COMPATABILITY WITH EXISTING TEC-1 SOFTWARE.
;   THE KEY ASSIGNMENTS FOR THE SC ARE;
;   FN BECOMES +
;   AD BECOMES -
;   + BECOMES GO
;   - BECOMES AD

;GLOSSARY
;
;---CURRENT EDITING LOCATION (082E)---
;THIS IS THE ADDRESS THAT IS USUALLY DISPLAYED IN THE ADDRESS SECTION ON THE TEC LED 
;DISPLAY. IT IS THE ADDRESS THAT IS SUBJECT TO MODIFICATION BY JMON.
;
;---MONITOR CONTROL BYTE (MCB) (082B)---
;THIS BYTE CONTAINS THE INPORMATION OF THE CURRENT WORKING STATE OF JMON. THE INFORMATION 
;HELD IN THIS BYTE IS:
;
;1 - THE CURRENT MODE OF JMON.
;
;E.G. DATA, ADDRESS OR FUNCTION (NOT SHIFT AS SHIFT IS TESTED AND HANDLED DURING THE DATA 
;KEY HANDLER ROUTINE). BITS 4 AND 5 ENCODE THE CURRENT MODE IN THE FOLLOWING WAY. BOTH 
;BITS ARE LOW FOR THE DATA MODE, BIT 4 IS HIGH FOR THE ADDRESS MODE, BITS 4 AND 5 ARE HIGH 
;FOR THE FUNCTION MODE. BIT 4 IS CALLED THE ADDRESS/FUNCTION BIT As THE SOFTWARE ONLY 
;NEEDS TO TEST THIS BIT TO FIND IF EITHER THE ADDRESS OR FUNCTION MODE IS ACTIVE. BIT 5 
;IS THE FUNCTION MODE ENABLED BIT.
;
;2 - THE NUMBER OF THE CURRENT FUNCTION I.E. 1,2 OR 3.
;
;THIS IS ENCODED IN BITS 2 AND 3. IF NO FUNCTION OR FUNCTION-1 IS ENABLED THEN BOTH BITS 
;ARE LOW. IF FUNCTION-2 IS SELECTED THEN BIT 2 IS HIGH AND BIT 3 IS LOW. IF FUNCTION-3 IS 
;SELECTED THEN BIT 3 IS HIGH AND BIT 2 IS LOW.
;
;3 - THE NUMBER OF NIBBLES ENTERED
;
;THIS IS ENCODED IN BITS 0 AND 1. IF NO NIBBLES HAVE BEEN ENTERED IN THE CURRENT EDITING 
;LOCATION THEN BOTH BIT ARE LOW. IF ONE NIBBLE HAS BEEN ENTERED THEN BIT 0 IS HIGH AND 
;BIT 1 IS LOW IS TWO NIBBLES HAVE BEEN ENTERED THEN BIT 0 IS LOW AND BIT 1 IS HIGH. JMON 
;USES THESE BITS WHEN DECIDING ON THE AUTO-INCREMENT FEATURE. BITS 6 AND 7 ARE NOT USED.
;
;---DISPLAY BUFFER ADDRESS - (082C/D)---
;THE CONTENTS OF 082C/D POINTS TO THE LOCATION IN MEMORY OF THE 6 BYTE DISPLAY BUFFER 
;(0800 FOR JMON AND 0806 FOR THE STEPPER). THE DISPLAY BUFFER ADDRESS POINTS TO THE LOWEST 
;ADDRESS OF THE DISPLAY BUFFER WHICH CONTAINS THE LOW ORDER DATA DISPLAY BYTE.
;
;KEY PLANT
;THE KEY PLANT IS A FAKE KEY STROKE THAT MAY BE GENERATED BY THE "DURING SCAN/REY LOOP" 
;USER PATCH. THE PLANT ALLOWS JMON'S MONITOR FUNCTIONS TO BE SOFTWARE CONTROLLED E.G. YOU 
;MAY WISH TO VIEW THE CONTENTS ,OF MEMORY BYTE BY BYTE. WITH THE KEY PLANT YOU CAN SET JMON 
;UP TO AUTOMATICALLY INCREMENT THE CURRENT EDIT LOCATION EVERY FEW SECONDS.
;THE PLANT IS IDENTIFIED BY THE USER PATCH STORING THE REQUIRED KEY VALUE IN, AND SETTING 
;BIT 7 OF THE INPUT KEY BUFFER (0820).
;
;---AUTO KEY STATUS BYTE (082A)---
;THIS BYTE HOLDS THE INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR THE AUTO KEY REPEAT SECTION. THE INFORMATION 
;HELD IN THIS BYTE IS EITHER ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:
;A "NEXT KEY DETECTION WILL BE A FIRST DETECTION" SO JMON WILL PROCESS THE KEY IMMEDIATELY 
;(BIT 7 HIGH) . A TIMER (BITS 0-6) THAT COUNTS, A DELAY FOR THE AUTO. REPEAT TIMING.
;
;KEY PRESS FLAG (0825)
;THIS FLAG IS USED TO REMEMBER IF THE ONE KEY PRESS HAS ALREADY BEEN DETECTED AND PROCESSED. 
;THIS PREVENTS THE SAME KEY BEING PROCESSED EACH TIME THE SOFTWARE FINDS THAT IT IS PUSHED. 
;THIS IS THE WAY IT WORKS:
;THE KEY PRESS FLAG 1S ZEROED BY THE JMON DEFAULT VARIABLES AND THIS FLAGS A "NO KEY 
;PRESSED" STATE. WHEN A KEY IS DETECTED THEN THIS FLAG IS TESTED AND IF ZERO THEN THE KEY 
;IS ACCEPTED AS A FIRST KEY PRESS. IN THIS CASE THE KEY PRESS FLAG IS THEN SET TO FF TO 
;REMEMBER THAT THE KEY PRESS HAS BEEN DETECTED. IF A KEY IS DETECTED AND THIS FLAG BYTE 
;IS NOT ZERO, THEN THE KEY IS IGNORED. WHEN THE SOFTWARE FINDS THAT NO KEY IS BEING PRESSED, 
;THEN THIS FLAG IS CLEARED TO ALLOW THE NEXT KEY PRESS DETECTED TO BE PROCESSED.
;THIS FLAG IS USED BY THE RST 08, RST 10 RST 18 AND RST 20 KEYBOARD ROUTINES AS DESCRIBED 
;IN ISSUE 15 TALKING ELECTRONICS AND ALSO THE STEPPER SOFTWARE.
;THE AUTO KEY REPEAT ROUTINE DOES NOT USE THIS FLAG BYTE, DO NOT CONFUSE THIS FLAG WITH 
;THE AUTO KEY STATUS BYTE WHICH IS USED BY THE AUTO KEY REPEAT SECTION.

;TAPE FILE INFORMATION BLOCK
;THIS IS A 12 BYTE BLOCK THAT CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:
;THE START ADDRESS OF THE BLOCK, THE NUMBER OF BYTES IN THE BLOCK, THE FILE NUMBER AND AN 
;OPTIONAL GO ADDRESS OR FFFF IF OPTIONAL GO IS DISABLED. THE OTHER 4 BYTES ARE NOT USED 
;AT THIS STAGE.
;THIS BLOCK IS OUTPUTTED AND INPUTTED TO AND FROM THE TAPE ON EACH TAPE OPERATION.
;
;"NEXT PC" BUFFER
;THIS IS A TEMPORARY PLACE TO SAVE THE RETURN ADDRESS WHICH IS THEN USED AS THE ACTUAL PC 
;VALUE FOR THE NEXT INSTRUCTION STEPPED.
;
;FORCED HARD RESET
;THIS IS ACHIEVED BY HOLDING DOWN A KEY WHEN RELEASING THE RESET. THE HARD RESET CAUSES 
;JMON TO RE-BOOT ITS VARIABLES AND ALSO MASK OFF ALL THE USER PATCHES (EXCEPT THE RESET 
;PATCH). THE MAIN PURPOSE OF A FORCED HARD RESET IS TO RECOVER THE TEC IF A USER PATCH 
;ENTERS A CONTINUOUS LOOP.
