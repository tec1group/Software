# Talking Electronics MicroComp
The MicroComp is a Z80 3-Chip micro computer and was published in Issue 13 and 14 of the Talking Electronic magazine.  It was published after the TEC and was considered very limiting compared to the TEC.  As it doesn't have any RAM or an easy method to modify code, to make it more practical, add-ons were needed which included RAM.  This then made it more like the TEC.

There were advertised 'Add-ons' but only the O's and X's game was published.  Pictures were shown of the Morse Code trainer, but no details were given.  Also, a Mastermind PCB was developed with incomplete code.  Only one board was ever made.  A Phone dialer program was also created that used extra RAM, but no details of the design was published.  There was talk of releasing more code for the upper rom, but again, nothing was released

Here is a collection of documents relating to the Microcomp 

## ROM's
- **microcomp_2k.rom** and **microcomp_variant.rom** The original code for the EPROM and a possibly older variant with only superficial changes.

- **microcomp_listing.pdf.** A complete annotated listing of the supplied EPROM

- **microcomp_4k_full.rom** TBA (stay tuned!)

## Publications
- **microcomp_publication.pdf** Part 1 and 2 of the Micro Comp publication in issue 13 adn 14 of the Talking Electronics Magazine.

- **microcomp_publication_part3.pdf** The third part of the Micro Comp publication.  This was in the BD679 book.

- **microcomp_theory.pdf** Electonic theory mostly centered around the Micro Comp and Z80 microprocessor.  This was published in Electroinic Notebook v3.

## Design
- **microcomp_artwork.png.** The back of the circuit board.

- **microcomp_schematic.png.** The schematic design

- **microcomp_board.jpg.** A scan of the original printed circuit board.

- **concept_board_design.png.** A concept design of the Micro Comp
